# ATTINY85-Digispark
Various sketches for running LEDs on Digispark

I developed these sketches with the help of wonderful examples available on the web. Most of the
time was spent in shrinking the code to make it fit into 6012 kb limitation of Digispark as the bootloaded takes up rest of the 8kb storage.
Feel free to use and share as long as you give due credit.

I will keep adding to the repo in future.

I also plan to add some code for D1 mini with wifi.

Thanks!
